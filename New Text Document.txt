How It Works
Isolation Forest Training:

The train_isolation_forest function creates a dataset of normal and anomalous login behaviors.
It trains an Isolation Forest model to distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns.
The trained model is saved to a file (anomaly_model.pkl) for future use.
Anomaly Detection:

The detect_anomaly function takes the number of logins and failed attempts as input.
It uses the trained Isolation Forest model to predict if the input data is an anomaly.
If the prediction indicates an anomaly (i.e., -1), it flags the login attempt.
Integrate into Flask:

During the login process (main_login route), the app checks if the login statistics (number of logins and failed attempts) indicate suspicious activity.
If an anomaly is detected, it alerts the user and prevents login.
Note
This example uses dummy data for training. In a real scenario, you would use actual login statistics.
Ensure you have the right data and model configuration for your specific use case.
This approach adds a layer of security but should be used in conjunction with strong authentication practices and other security measures.
Feel free to adapt the algorithm and data according to your specific needs and conte
